= Safe Password Hashes for ChiliProject

This plugin will further improve the security of your users passwords. While
stock ChiliProject currently uses salted SHA1 hashes to store passwords, this
plugin will switch the storage to PBKDF2 based hashes. This will take
significantly longer to compute and is therefor more robust against brute force
attacks.

This is work in progress.
